This was my first ever end to end project in the field of data science. I was just getting into the field and was interested in the kind of money that data scientists make in the US



linkedin, javascript component more difficult to scrape

glassdoor, salary data which is useful, glassdoor est (not good to use variable which is an estimate)

scraping the data
bs4 -> organizes the html on a page and lets us pull some of the elements
selenium -> a bot that goes through and clicks on elements of a page and copies them to a dataframe

glassdoor uses java script so better to use selenium 

found glassdoor scraper resource
changed path to my chromdriver

pop up window issue, I needed to bypass the sign up prompt. Code was not working 

We can click by element instead of a class

changed find_element_by_class_name to  find_element_by_css_selector

one more issue was it filtered jobs only for san Francisco

issue with salary estimate, everything is -1

edited the url, changed span class for salary estimate


Data Cleaning

cleaning up the salary estimate by removing "(Glassdoor est.)", remove K, remove "-", remove $, take avg of range
parse number out of company name
split the state name 
change founded variable to how long the company has been around
parsing job description to find skills like python, spark, R. How different salary estimate will be associated with that

removed salary with value -1

minus_kd -> remove K and dollar signs

some has per hour so converted to annual salary

company name has some ratings, remove

is job location same as HQ


Model Building

. get dummy data
